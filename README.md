General 1.3 Notes: This is a work in progress and very buggy. The json structuring needs a lot of work and probably a good bit of cleanup considering this is all new terrain for me! Some things may or may not work so use at your own risk!   

Installation:

Step 1: Copy "mods" folder into your D2R installation directory.

Step 2: Copy the "Settings.json" file from here C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected

Step 3: Make a folder in the same directory named "mods"

Step 4: Make another folder inside the newly created "mods" folder and name it "nohd"

Step 5: Paste the 'Settings.json' (from Step 2) into the newly created "nohd" folder.

Step 6: Run Battle.net Launcher, click the gear icon and go to 'Game Settings'

Step 7: Enable "Additional command line arguments"

Step 8: Type in the command line arguments "-mod nohd" (no quotes)

Step 9: Save changes and click the 'Play' button!

Usage:

When first entering a game the screen will be black.
Once your character is in a game press the G key to see something.

Notes:

Using the -sndbkg command line argument on the main and -ns on any other instances of the game helps with sound issues when multiboxing. 

If playing the game in a 800x600 fullscreen window there is a Town Portal bug where entering a portal from town may require two attempts or be avoided by clicking and holding while taking Town Portals. This bug does not occur when taking any portals other than portals located in town.

Legacy Guard (a smaller version of Legacy Guardian) is a Python script for Nvidia GPUs that monitors the usage threshold
and then sends the G key to the active D2R window when the GPU usage reaches the configured percentage.
